            Housework is the New Technology</h3>
           <a href="https://youtu.be/jb36JazVcQw">Watch the video</a>
           <p>Video Transcription</p>
           <p>Housework is the new engineering. At least it should be. Nowhere in the world have domestic tools been designed appropriately. The digital community has neglected the true starting point of technology. Everday life is where technology begins. Domestic technology, known as white goods, which are used within the home are seen as less than. As opposed to high technology, known as brown goods, which are used within the working world and seen as impressive, and honorable to design. Because white goods are valued less, their development is stunted. “The designing of household appliances is a hybrid activity mingling domestic practical experience and industrial formalization. To accomplish their work, the innovators bring the domestic world into the company. However, it is only in a reconstructed form, rendering them relevant to the company that domestic actors and practices are brought in" (Cockburn, 1997, p.364). “Take away; to understand media, we need to understand its relationship to history culture and society” (Harley, 2023).The neglect of domestic technology will be the downfall of the home. "In a profitgoverned society there is no socially-responsible agent of technological planning. The latest model from the drawing board of a manufacturer is designed only to compete with that of his rivals for space in the actually-existing household" (Cockburn, 1997, p.365). Meaning that white goods are produced only with the goal of profit, rather than truly adequate design and consumer satisfaction. The fear is the possibility that the household will become an island. The isolation that domestic technology faces will continue to diminish domestic and high technologies quality. Take away: “Context is hard to interpret at scale and even harder to maintain when data are reduced to fit into a model” (Boyd & Crawford, 2012, p.671). The way society views the household contributes greatly to its downfall. Many designers and engineers feel put down when discussing their work in white goods. Two distinct thought processes known as the actor-network approach and The Social Construction of Technology (SCOT) are to blame. The actor network approach refers to the concept and belief that everything is connected in a network of interactive relationships. Whether it’s through technology or even just people. The SCOT approach alludes to the idea that technology is shaped by society rather than society being shaped by the digital world. Though SCOT also emphasizes “interpretive flexibility” which is, “the notion that innovations are not complete until they are in use, and that the technology of the originators may be subjected to many unforeseen adaptations” (Cockburn, 1997, p.369). This plays into the idea of instrumentarianism meaning, “the instrumentation and instrumentalization of human behavior for the purposes of modification, prediction, monetization, and control," and which, “denotes the social relations that orient the puppet master's to human experience"(Zuboff, 2019, p.20). Now what if Cinderella WAS an engineer? Would she have fostered a better relationship between society’s technology and that of households? Would she have staged an intervention? Would she have governed the effects of digital culture and the growing issues within it? Would she have helped create a more digitally diverse environment for other minorities including racial and religious groups? Would she have helped us avoid the dire issues of today’s digital culture? Ovulation tracking could have continued to be a great resource rather than having it turned against women in the United States as it’s used as a surveillance technology on account of the new abortion laws in many states. AI Bias could have been controlled. "Today, online apps based on data mainly collected from men may suggest to a female user that her symptoms of pain in the left arm and back may be due to depression. The medical app might advise the women to see the doctor in a couple of days. In contrast, a male user of the app is more likely to be asked to immediately contact his doctor based on a diagnosis of a possible heart attack" (Niethammer, 2020). “To ask questions about what happens to our data is to ask questions about power and control” (Harley, 2023).</p>
           <p>The Process</p>
           <p>I chose to depict Cockburn’s article, Cinderella and the Engineers, as my video essay. This reading played into my role in our final group project. Our topic, Sex and Gender in digital culture, sparked my interest and has guided my studies throughout this semester. I continued to delve into this subject when conducting my Knowledge Translation. I began by reassessing my notes from the beginning of the term. I also took the time to reread the article in order to grasp a new understanding of the content. Moving into the next phase of my project, I summarized the reading into two pages of content. This way, I was able to distinguish which information was most important. I also made a point to choose and cite my sources during this stage. This helped me prepare and save time towards the end of the project.  After deciding which information from the article was to be included in my video essay, I chose to do some further research. I took the steps to discover what extra information to leave my viewers with. During this stage, I finalized my script and plan for video content.  When going out to take my video content I ensured to take lots of “B-Roll content”. I wanted to have excess video footage to choose from when editing my video essay. I focused mainly on capturing both white and brown goods. I wanted my video to reflect the differences between the two types of technology as I felt that it was one of the more important points within the article. During my filming I took chances and risks. I had stumbled upon an engineering professor when recording shots of the engineering building on the main campus. I took a chance to speak with him as I knew there was a chance that he would be able to show me his lab. This is where I got some really great footage and was able to talk with him about my subject and his role in brown technology.  The white good footage was also a challenge. Finding the right place to film domestic technology, that I don’t own myself, was cause for thinking outside the box. I visited the mall and was able to capture domestic technology in realistic looking settings!  During the editing stage I referred to my sketches I had drawn in my beginning stages while also looking at my script. This is how I decided the placement of all of my different clips. I used quick cuts between shots in order to encapsulate the fast pace of the technological community. I also chose to do a voice over which allowed me to fill my video with lots of content without overwhelming the viewer. However, quotes were included and written on the screen. This was intentional and meant to draw viewers’ attention to the important quotes from the article.  After visuals, audio, and typography were completed I was nearing the end of my assignment. A review and peer editing allowed me to finalize my work. </p>
           <p>Obective</p>
           <p>My objective was to recreate the contents of the article in a shortened video format. When creating my work, I tried to imagine a student watching my short video essay rather than reading the entire article. What pieces relate to the rest of the course? How can I explain this in simple terms? How might a GBDA or Engineering student best take in this information? How can I catch their eye? “Housework is the new engineering”. Deciding on my audience gave me direction with the design of my video. Something fast paced and easy to understand. </p>
           <p>Reflective</p>
           <p>I made a point of relating the content of this article to other themes and topics I’ve been introduced to this term. In each section of the video essay, I quote a takeaway either given in class or pulled from a different reading. I began strongly with a quote from Daniel Harley, “Take away; to understand media, we need to understand its relationship to history culture and society” (Harley, 2023). Specifically, the Big Data and Surveillance Capitalism readings closely related to the topics I discussed within my Knowledge Translation. I related Cockburn’s ideologies to the different effects of data limitations, and the concept of instrumentation of people and devices within the technological world.  My personal response to this article came in the last section of my video essay where I begin by saying, “Now what if Cinderella WAS an engineer? Would she have fostered a better relationship between society’s technology and that of households?”. Here I left viewers with questions. These were things that, I too, initially wondered. My further research helped me understand the implications of the current, bias structure of the digital design world. These questions were posed in order to guide viewers to these same understandings.</p>
           <p>Interpretive</p>
           <p>Throughout my work on this assignment, I came to many realizations. I began to understand the importance of visual content as well as writing content. Many people are visual learners, and the video essay format can be a critical tool in the design world. I also learned more about my subject matter within the GBDA203 Digital Culture class. I am beginning to grasp how each reading is related to the next. Much of the content that is presented to us goes hand in hand with topics, discussions and other readings assigned in class. I also learned how valuable “B-Roll content” can be. This allowed me to play around with different ideas and concepts without the stress of having to rerecord. I Also considered the objects in which I was filming. Going from experiencing brown technology to white technology greatly highlighted the many design differences between the two.</p>
           <p>Decisional</p>
           <p>After this assignment my awareness of the biases in digital culture will be heightened. Through this assignment I have gained a better understand of the influences of the digital world. How even the smallest design decisions can alter the state of society. Moving forward, understanding the implications of gendered issues within AI bias, surveillance capitalism, and the design world will help further my knowledge of what makes digital culture so intricate. I have learned, with the help of my professor, that to communicate academic research through video requires us to show, not tell and to have a good understanding of your audience. </p>
           <p>Conclusion</p>
           <p>I have greatly enjoyed this assignment and have gained lots of experience. Communicating my thoughts and opinions, portraying a concept through video, and getting outside and becoming a videographer has been challenging and incredibly rewarding. I am passionate about this topic and feel that delving into this assignment has given me an opportunity to acquire more control over my contributions to digital culture.</p>
